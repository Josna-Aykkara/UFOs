## Summary

**Drawback:**
The website is collaborative and supports the user to get the required results, but the filter field is case sensitive and requires the user to input the exact information in lowercase. There is no information or guide provided to the user regarding how to use the filters.

**Recommendations:**
    
•	***Case sensitive:*** It would be beneficial to the user if the input field for city or country was not case sensitive. It would add input flexibility and better customer experience by the user on the website.
    
•	***Date range:*** The user is not able to select multiple dates from the dataset. If the date range field is included then the user would be able to analysis the data depending on the data range such as for a month, week or customised time period.
    
•	***Drop Down Menu:*** A drop down menu would be highly recommended to be added to the website, as it would enable the user to be informed about the data available at hand and to decide which data the user would require. It also hints to the user that the data is from a small dataset and would display the names of the city’s whose information is available. In the current website the user wouldn’t be notified if the city inputted doesn’t have any information.
    
•	***Reset button:*** The reset button option is recommended as the user can get the desired information based on the various filters inputted. It would enable the user to easily change the filter settings and change the search range accordingly to the user preference.
